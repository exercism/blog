At the start of September 2021, Exercism v3 finally launched.
Angelika Tyborska is one of the key maintainers that helped us get over the line.
As well as being the co-creator of the Elixir Learning Exercises and Syllabus, Angelika was a key voice throughout the development of v3, adding ideas and insight throughout the build-process.
She is a key Exercism contributor.

In this video presentation, Angelika talks us through what problems v3 was designed to fix, some of the key additions to the platform, and how everything fits together, exploring Analyzers, Representers and the new Learning Exercises.
