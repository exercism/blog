Last week we wrote a blog post announcing the [Automated Mentoring Support Project](https://exercism.io/blog/automated-mentoring-support-project) and discussed our plans for adding [static analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_analysis) to Exercism. Following on from that, we're incredibly excited to be able to now publically announce that we have been awarded a [Mozilla Open Source Support Award](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) to support this project.

The grant will help fund three key areas of our static analysis work:
1) The product design and development to allow static analysis to work alongside mentoring within the Exercism UI
2) The infrastucture required to run static-analysis and the integration of this into the submission pipeline
3) A proof-of-concept for Two Fer in Ruby that will give us reference documentation for other languages/exercises

We're extremely grateful to Mozilla, and excited to be able to dedicate some full-time people-power to the product and infrastructure sides of the project, which will be so important moving forward. We feel that this addition of static analysis to [Exercism](https://exercism.io) will dramatically increase our ability to serve a wider community and make mentoring a more enjoyable and rewarding activity.
