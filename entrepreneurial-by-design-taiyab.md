# Transcript: Entrepreneurial By Design - Taiyab Raja


**Jonathan:** Hello and welcome to the Exercism podcast. It's Jonathan here, and I'm joined by Taiyab a, not by, with tie a tie. Taiyab has been an integral part in the whole design of Exercism and another company called Kaido. You can go and check that one out as well. Kaido.org. But Exercism is the one that he's spent a lot of his time recently putting together, especially moving it from V2 to v3. We'll drill into that a little bit later. But Ty, it's super to have you here with us today. Thank you for your time. Thank you for joining us. Tell us where are you currently, what are you doing? And tell us a little bit about yourself.

**Taiyab:** So first of all Jonathan, thanks for taking the time out to speak. Much appreciated. Ooh, where do I start? I guess right from the beginning, right? Origin stories. This is
Yeah, so I was gonna say I was born . No. So let's go. Let's start from somewhere a bit relevant.
So I guess the best place to start is probably, I guess where I grew up. Where I was born. So I was born in Birmingham in the uk. In quite a, looking at it now, quite a deprived area actually. So I'm from a town actually just technically slightly outside of Birmingham called there's literally almost like a border sign.
If you just walk like five, five seconds down the road, there's like a border that says Birmingham, and then on one side it says sematic, and on one side it says Birmingham. So technically I'm like on the outside of it. But yeah, it's quite a deprived area at. As I've been growing up, it's very diverse, very multicultural.
Like everyone's here from everywhere, like all over the world. It's quite, it's been quite an interesting experience growing up here. Like I'm currently still in the same area, in the same city. And yeah, like it's been interesting getting to be in a place where you have a complete melting part of ideas, a complete melting part of different types of people with different perspectives from all over the world.
And that, I think, shaped me in a lot of ways I see the world today. I always acknowledge that there's another. Perspective out there, and that, like the world is way greater than just my little part of it. So yeah. And I would say that my father likes going back a bit to like my father and my mother and all that side of things too.
My father was very entrepreneurial as well. Just for context, he was a migrant to the country, so he migrated from Pakistan. Secondly technically I'm a second and third generation immigrant, I guess cuz my grandfather, Yeah, my grandfather and my father both migrated to the country.
So my father actually migrated after World War ii. And that's a whole separate story.
Yeah.

**Jonathan:** That's a while. A while ago. Hey. Yeah.

**Taiyab:** Yeah a long while ago. He was actually born in, believe it or not, he was born in 1901. So my grandfather is old. Yeah, he's very

**Jonathan:** still

**Taiyab:** No. He died when I was young. He died about 30 years ago, Roughly.

**Jonathan:** I was gonna say cuz he, he'd be like a hundred, 119 now,

**Taiyab:** Yeah, he'd be very old right now. But yeah, so that's a whole different story, but both my grandfather and my father migrated to the country. So yeah, whatever that makes me, I dunno what that makes me, second generation or whatever.

**Jonathan:** Just, Was it just that Birmingham was a natural landing point, or,

**Taiyab:** No.

**Jonathan:** yeah.

**Taiyab:** So initially we actually started. I say we like my, my, my father's family and how we settled here. I think they started in the south of England first. I can't remember exactly where. I think it was near Surry. In the south of England.
And the reason why they started there is just as a, I think, as a consequence of the war.
So what happened is my grandfather moved to Surrey. In fact he actually had to escape to Surrey. So what happened is in the Battle of DunKirk, basically in World War II, my grandfather was fighting in that war. Yeah. And he.

**Jonathan:** on the

**Taiyab:** He was deployed? Yeah, he was deployed there. So he wasn't he was part of the, what they call like the transport company or like basically shipping supplies to the frontline basically.
And what ended up happening he had to make sure he had to escape in the retreat too, and he ended up, Where they ended up in the south of England, obviously as a result of the evacuation at the time. And so that was his first, I think, exposure to the south of England and being there and all that sort of stuff.
And then later on he moved there as well and actually migrated and settled there too. So we have a bit of a history from the war basically in being in the country. And then also my father. Came over after World War II and stuff and all that. And, for economic reasons as a migrant came and then worked in the country and all that.
Because I come from a very. I guess hardworking migrant background,
Like that, those sorts of that sort of grit and that sort of like mindset was drilled into me quite a bit. My father was always very entrepreneurial, like a hustler gogetter type. He like had he's been in every business you can think of
He started.
Yeah.
To name, but a few he started out selling leather jackets in a, on a weekend market.
He got into warehousing, so he used to like warehouse kitchenware and that sort of stuff. Then he started his own store selling those goods as well as retail.
Then he was the driving instructor for a long time. Then he did, he's basically done everything.
, he's done it all. So I feel like that's where I got some of my entrepreneurial DNA from, definitely from him. And so what I started doing, this is going in now a bit to the story of tech and how I got into it is basically I was always a very entrepreneurial kid.
Like always What happened is I had a lot of siblings, so I have four brothers and two sisters, so quite a community of us.

**Jonathan:** Football team. Go.

**Taiyab:** It's like a football team. Yeah. Yeah. We just rock up somewhere and we just take over the place. Yeah. But it's nice having a lot of siblings in, in a lot of ways because you get to like bouncing ideas off each other.
You get to especially grow up, you play around with each other a lot. You're always fighting.

**Jonathan:** You can't get away with a bad idea. It's gonna get pulled down and trampled on

**Taiyab:** Exactly. So there, there's no place for for nonsense, basically

**Jonathan:** Yeah.

**Taiyab:** But what I used to do, taking advantage of this community is I would always be the guy or the brother that would like to see an opportunity and then try and take it, right? I remember selling sweets and things to my brothers when we were really small.
This is like an eight or something or whatever, right? I'd be the guy who would hoard all the sweets and the chocolates and everything. And then as soon as it was late at night and like my siblings were like, Oh, I want chocolate. I want a sweet, I want this. I'll be like, You can buy it off me.
It's only a pan.

**Jonathan:** Or you must have done pretty well, I tell you. Yeah.

**Taiyab:** I was yeah, I was doing pretty well as a kid with the, with all that stuff. And then like growing up I carried on, like having this kind of, seeing the market. Seeing the demand and trying to fill it, mindset. And then I do the same thing in school as well. I sold stuff in school and got in trouble for that as well.
That's a different thing as well. But then carried on doing this more and then obviously discovered the internet. Everybody got on this was in me, this was when I was probably about 10, 11, 12 years old. We got the whole dialup modem and did all that and got connected to tell me.
That noise is still
etched. Still etched in the, Yeah, and I still get frustrated when people pick up the phone. And it used to cut the line off as well.

**Jonathan:** Yeah. Oh, that was so

**Taiyab:** Yeah. But yeah, and they got connected to the web and then just got into like, all sorts of stuff from there. My family, we were all like really big gamers.
So we got into all the games, like typically played a lot of RPGs actually. This is for the gamer nerd, but we played a lot of Korean. Growing up, so this is like lineage to and also some western ones too, like ro scape as well. That was the game to play. This is back in the early 2000, so

**Jonathan:** link will be in the show notes, presumably if it still exists.

**Taiyab:** It's still Ro Scaps, definitely still around and Lineage is. Here and there, but link in the channel for sure. . But yeah. And then we got from there and then this is where the tech stuff starts. So I got into gaming and then basically my brother was really into it.
His games and therefore joined clans and stuff for them. And then these clans and these guilds, they needed websites and stuff, right?
They started building communities around them. Like my brother would be the guy who then they would go to and say can you like make a website for this, please?
Or this webpage, right? And this was back in the day when you used to use something called Microsoft Front Page , which is like a, what is what you get editor. Do you remember that?

**Jonathan:** I can't say I do, it sounds like a primitive version of Ws. or
It's like the most basic fundamental version of that.

**Taiyab:** Yeah, basically. And what people used to do on the front page is they used to design an image as the webpage, Stick it on. Yeah. Stick it on the front page or whatever. And then you used to, in order to put content in, you would have to cut out a slice of the image, set it as the background, and then add the text on top of.

**Jonathan:** I see.

**Taiyab:** So that is how you used to create webpage is essentially an image and you just slice it up into a million different pieces and then present it with some of the things as background and text

**Jonathan:** So a very primitive version of react and components on some level, you could say we're getting

**Taiyab:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Jonathan:** To this point, but Okay. No

**Taiyab:** yeah. So this is OG internet, right? This is how it all, this is how it all began. And then what I used to do, this is back in the time where households had one shared computer amongst everyone in the house. So you know, the.

**Jonathan:** or

**Taiyab:** eight siblings. I was a professional backseat gamer, a professional backseat developer.
. I would just sit behind my brother watching Oh, do this, do that. Oh, you should move this over there. You should do that.

**Jonathan:** Of all strategists, yeah. No, don't do that. That's it.

**Taiyab:** and . And I think one day he just got so frustrated. He goes, he just turns around to me and goes there. Just do it yourself, design your own website and then and then you can do this all yourself. Stop, tell, stop telling me what to do. And then I was like, Okay, sure .

**Jonathan:** Aside. Thank you very much.

**Taiyab:** Yeah.
So when it was my turn on the computer, I would then go on and start designing websites and things for various things I was interested in.
It was always about what was cool at the time. So I was quite into anime and Gundam and that sort of stuff at the time as well into Dragon Ball Z, that sort of stuff. So yeah, I would create websites for those things I was interested in. And then go from there a little bit.
And then what happened is I started getting more and more into it. I joined a few forums. Around the idea of freelancing and design and all sorts of stuff. Cause I started thinking maybe I can make some money freelancing or something by being a designer. And this is when I also started getting into code more as well.
Obviously first in websites and then other stuff later.
And then, yeah, Caroline progressed from there. Got more into designing websites to do all that sort of.

**Jonathan:** So did the design side of things. Was that where you veered towards you? You might say, Was it Okay, I want to design this. Oh therefore I need to know a bit of JavaScript. Was it that way around? Because I'm gonna learn to code. Oh no, I need to learn how to design on top of that.
So was your design led, Essentially.

**Taiyab:** No it was, everything was from a very utilitarian standpoint, right? So I need to launch this website for this idea that I have. How do I do it right? Oh, I need to learn this. I need to learn that. I need to learn that, right? So it was from a.

**Jonathan:** down the rabbit Warren with learning essentially. Yeah.

**Taiyab:** Down the rabbit hole. Yep, exactly. It was, yeah, all, everything I ever did was from a utilitarian standpoint. So it was just Yeah, here's an idea I have, or here's something that I wanna bring to market. How do I do it?

**Jonathan:** Inform your design now? Even Cuz I love your designs. I think
Clear and easy to understand from a practical perspective. And so I can now see that there's clearly train of thought that runs through how you think through

**Taiyab:** Yeah. Yeah. I would say so. Say so. Definitely I think with design especially, it has to achieve the clarity and the objectives that's needed, right? That's why it's super important early on to be defining what it is you want this page to do on, on, on mul, on multiple levels. So not just on like what buttons or what things do we want people to do when they get off here, or what do we want them to know, but also emotively, what do we want people to feel when they're on there?
And what are the primary things that we want people to do and feel when they're on that page? So whenever you do any piece of design work, the first thing you do is you define objectives. You define I want people to come on here and do X, Y, and Z. And then think of everything through that lens.
And also when you, when it comes to designing a page, you always wanna think it through from a very heavily emotional standpoint too.
So I'll give you an example. So if you're talking about a recent page that we're designing about this, we're actually building a page on Exercism to describe or show the build state of a track right now.
That, for example, requires a multitude of things. First, it requires what I call the activation, which is Getting people emotionally invested in that thing first. So what I find is when it comes to modeling somewhere to do something first, you need to get them emotionally invested.
Then you gotta show them the details of what needs to be done, right? So that whole top of the page is dedicated to showing impact as and therefore motivating people or emotionally connecting with them so that they are emotionally invested in doing this thing. So just seeing the impact of their work.
So the headline is, 50,000 students have benefited from the Alexa track for augments. And then once you've established the emotive connection and once you've given that piece of motivation to them at the beginning, then you can go into the depth and detail of things, right?
So much anything, it basically has to follow a story that makes sense from top to bottom.
.
And as long as you're following that through line where you are and you're accounting for people who both know about your service and don't know about your service, or are part of the ex Exercism community, or not part of the Exercism community, or are senior maintainers or lower level maintainers, you gotta think of all those personas and then feed them through that story and see if it makes sense.

**Jonathan:** Okay so looking at Exercism then, pulling back as a whole, what were some of the key emotional things that you were trying to hit with Exercism? Like when you were redesigning version three? Or can you explain how you went from version two, which was where it was, where did you get involved again with Exercism?
Was it V one or V two?

**Taiyab:** so just past the. Yeah, so just past the launch of v2 so Lev two had just launched Jeremy had done a very kind of detailed analysis of the launch of v2. What happened, I think it may have, might have been a year after that or two. I'm not sure exactly when, but he had done something like a blog post on breaking down v2, like what impact it had on the user base and signups and all that sort of stuff.
And that's the point that I got involved in. So it was roughly two years before the launch. Fee three.

**Jonathan:** Okay. So then, you've come in at v2 just post V2 launch and you're now gonna re envision this platform for learning to code. What
were your, what, How did you go about that? What were the sort of key things that you were trying to hit? Yeah, I'd love to
find out a little bit about how you

**Taiyab:** Yeah, for sure. It started off with a huge amount of sync from Jeremy and I, so at the time it was only Jeremy and I that were working on the XS and B3 product per se.
So we were the people who were gonna do everything and Jeremy was gonna code it all, and I was gonna design it all right?
And that was it. And we're talking about a huge platform here with so much to it. It looks simple from the

**Jonathan:** Out, you're like, Oh, it's hard. Can it be? And then sort of nine months later you're like, another modal

**Taiyab:** Tell me about it. Literally. It was, that's like the, one of the signs of I think somebody, that's what we all do, right? So at the beginning we have to look at things in a very simplistic way. Let's say even if we take a business idea or a product that you're building or whatever it is, we say, Oh yeah, that shouldn't be too e that shouldn't be too difficult.
Because we don't quite know the details of it. Or we're just thinking, Oh, this will be interesting. And we need that sort of naivety to get into it a little bit. And then also then the grip that comes with then seeing the detail of it and then saying, Okay, let's break this up into small pieces.
Let's try and do this bit first and then this bit. And then once you like to get into the detail of it and understand how complex and fast that problem is, then just having, or just developing, I should say, the grit and the. The consistency to be able to execute on a long term plan, right?
So you need both naive, high level thinking at the beginning just to say, Oh, we should do this thing. And then the execution and the deep work part of the actual doing.

**Jonathan:** Yeah, I agreed. It's like it's, You need to get to that point where you're like, Oh, we're too far down the road to turn back

**Taiyab:** Yep. Yeah, there's no heading back from here. Yeah, for sure. But going back to how the process began, I guess it's basically a huge amount of sync from Jeremy and I at the beginning. So we spoke, I think we spent three, like I'd say about four or five hours a day chatting to each other for a week straight.
Or something. And that was just like figuring out our philosophies on things. Figuring out our intentions for things like me, just getting a good understanding of where things are at with exom too. So just downloading all his thinking on where we're at, what the history's been, why we're here.
A lot of the time when it comes to design, you wanna know how somebody got to that point. So you know what they eliminated in the. So I know not to go down those routes that might waste a lot of time or they've already been explored or whatever. So it was important for me coming on the project to just really understand everything and not just to try and be like, Oh yeah, that needs to be changed, so we should change this without even knowing whether it had been addressed before.
So yeah, it was a lot of syncing up, but a lot of that and then we just took it bit by bit. So I started out just doing some, like more creative conceptual things.
What I find with these sorts of things is there needs to be a period of exploration of I guess opening your mind or opening your, opening up the possibilities as to what could be done.
So that would just be messing around with various visual styles messing around with certain layouts of particular pages, that sort of stuff, just trying to get a feel for the thing you're going for. And one of the core ideas or core principles in my head that I wanted to base everything off, Was basically this idea of access accessibility, right?
So code is seen or programming is seen as a thing that's very inaccessible. It's seen as very difficult and it is quite difficult for sure especially at times. It's a new skill. Skill that requires a tremendous amount of effort to acquire as new skills do. So as a result of that, it needed to.
and as a direct response to that, the website itself, or the design itself, or the branding itself needs to be approachable. It needs to be approachable. It needs to seem fun and easy.
And it needs to feel like I am maybe somewhat of a novice programmer who can come in and do stuff, right?
This is not some exclusive community of just hardcore depths.

**Jonathan:** Where your forum is like a nightmare to even decrypt

**Taiyab:** Exactly. Yeah, you just click on, you're like, Yeah, I don't know what's going on. And you click off. That's what we didn't want to have happen. Everything revolved around that. So even though we're talking about the iconography on the site, everything seems very happy and smiley and approachable, colorful.
It was all just, Come in, get involved and do your best. And it's also one of the things that informed us, like how we did the whole peak end stuff. So peak end is this idea that it's like the emotions or the impact you want somebody to feel when they are, when they've gone through a journey and they're hitting like the success part of it or the end goal of it.
And so even as we designed what the end of an exercise looked like or what the completion of a track looked like or whatever, we always wanted to keep in mind this idea that we wanted to catapult people into learning and
Those barriers that they would have.
And also, one of the goals that I had was to learn. Habitual as well
That it would overcome a lot of the barriers that you have in terms of just having to get up and practice every day or something.
Try and make it a habit.

**Jonathan:** type

**Taiyab:** The slogging it out and that's what it is really. Yeah.
Yeah.
ex. Exactly. And that's what it really all is, right? With any skill, it's deliberate practice. It's waking up every morning and thinking, Oh, I should learn this thing. I should co spend a couple hours deliberate practice on this thing. And that's how we all get better. So essentially building in a lot of those you know how, like, how we get.
Addicted to social media and they're built to be addicted. I know it's hard to do that with things that are difficult, but I wanted to try and create as much as possible with this too. So to make something hard, like learning addiction too, which is a much harder goal for sure.

**Jonathan:** And so how did they do it? So clearly in the site there's an element of, I mean that we throw the term around gamification all over the shop, and it's like a bit of a buzzword right in, in tech, let's gamify everything. But how did you approach that in a way that was meaningful and appropriate?
Because it's, it is a term that is thrown around, but clearly it, if it's done it's really
positive.

**Taiyab:** Yeah,
So GA gamification is all about effort and reward, right? And in reality, all it really is elevating or making, clearly defined what the rewards are for the effort that's made, right? So what I, so I think I feel with things like badges and things like that, and reputation even to a large extent, it's all just geared around making sure that the things you're rewarding are things that are worth rewarding.
And that's it really. So for example let's say somebody completed the Alexa track for arguments sake. Creating a badge for that and rewarding that is a very sensible thing to do in terms of elevating and clarifying to that person that, Wow, you did something great here. So it's not just about adding numbers and scores and badges and things to random things.
It's about associating it to the actual learning and behavior patterns that people experience when they use a certain. So to me it's all about things being me.
If a gamification element is either rewarding me for a behavior that I did correctly or well or a desired behavior, then it's amazing.
But if you're just introducing points for some, a relatively meaningless or arbitrary reason, that's when you're gonna get the confusion and you're gonna get the problems, right? Even when we came to us designing reputation, for example, , it needs to be that you had some meaningful contribution to the platform in order to gain reputation, and then that reputation would truly serve as a way of showing your contribution to the community and hence your sort of I guess your status in things as well.

**Jonathan:** Okay. And so now then coming back, what was, and so if we rewind a little bit
You started out coding and designing and all of that, how did you from a coding perspective now what was your journey, your process, then how did you motivate yourself to. To learn that.

**Taiyab:** Yeah. I'd say, yeah, it was all just about trying to launch certain products and services. So being the entrepreneurial kid or whatever it was, Oh, I had this idea for a business. Okay, let me see if I can build a product to then sell to people and then sell and then even sell the business.
Back in that time, there was also like a website called Site Point that a lot of people used. This was like a reference for developers, web developers specifically to use. And it talked about all the new cool ways you could use CSS and do this and do that.
It also had a marketplace there.
So people would actually come and sell their businesses there and buy businesses there, or sell domains. Yeah. Yeah. And so I got really involved in this, so once I saw like all the businesses being sold for there was like a website that was I think selling like golf clubs or something, I can't remember.
Something random. And it was like, it sold for $10,000. And I was like, and this is when I was like 15, 16 years old, right? So I looked at this and I. . I was like 10 grand. I could do with 10 grand right now. So what I ended up doing is just basically trying to launch products and services and then having to learn how to code on the back of them.
So one day I would have an idea for a product or service, let's say. I don't know, I wanna create in fact, one of the work websites I did create very early on and forgive me for this was when it was acceptable, but I create this like a, basically just a link page I guess you could call it.
So back in the day you had this idea called, I think the million dollar webpage or something, right? Where somebody would sell advertising on every pixel of their thousand by thousand page.

**Jonathan:** Remember those ones? Yeah.

**Taiyab:** Yeah. So I did something similar to that, which was essentially just a list, like a huge page, which is like a list of links essentially.
And this is. I was 12 years old, so guys, forgive me for this
right? Forgive me this, but I would basically sell links on that website and then people would like, like the next link that got purchased for, let's say $5 would go to the top of the list and then the list would just keep growing and the next link would go up and up.
And basically I would wake up Every day and check my phone. And this was back when

**Jonathan:** The Nokia 33 10.

**Taiyab:** Oh yeah. No, there were still, I think there were smartphones at time, but they were just very

**Jonathan:** Yeah.

**Taiyab:** . And I would see like 10 new sales or whatever on the thing that I was doing.
That really motivated me. So then I just carried on learning from there. And then I did like eventually after doing the whole Like hustling on site point and selling, selling all these products and services. Making a bit of money on that. And then I actually did go to university for computers.

**Jonathan:** Okay.

**Taiyab:** So I did take the formal step after that. So it was, first it was very utilitarian. It was, let's just learn how to build this thing for the sake of getting it to market. And then it turned into, okay, let's actually study this thing more in depth. So I went to university, did computer science. Of course a large part of that is programming.
And that's where I got heavily involved in doing. Game development and C shop JavaScript, that sort of stuff. And that's the perspective I took from it. So I did go to university then for computer science.

**Jonathan:** And how did you find then the commercial businessy piece, and then obviously the nuts and bolts of learning computer science, which is probably on a, like a bit of a lower level than the business side of things,
but how did you then weave those two things together? Because, you know that those are two very different perspectives, but
they're very linked.
Yeah.

**Taiyab:** Yeah, they're very, it's like approaching the same problem from two perspectives, right? One is, I have a problem first, how do I solve it? And one is I'm building relatively generic skills, and then they're gonna apply to some sort of problem later on, right? So I always find that it was difficult to motivate myself when I wasn't working from the problem first.
And when I was just generically learning something, it didn't, because it. Directly lead to something. I found that a very difficult motivational path to take, like a very difficult executional path to take. So while I was at university, I was doing both. What ended up happening is, the thing that really sparked my kind of love of programming to a large extent was when we had a like a first year project to do of developing a.
So rather than just learning things in theory and saying, Okay, theoretically, here's how you do this and that, and go and practice it, it was No, here's the end goal. You're gonna make a game and let's work backwards from there and here's how you're gonna. . So
Like I mentioned before, we, I, my family and I, all my siblings, come from a gaming background.
So making a game was like, Yeah, let's do that, right?
I'm gonna do that one. And yeah. And so when it came to doing it that way around, yeah, here's what we wanna do and then let's work backwards on that, then I was highly motivated to do all of it in any of it. But I always struggled with just learning in isolation with no end real, like distinct end goal that was,

**Jonathan:** Okay. And so now gaming and you've built this game, and so you've, let's just go through, so you've, you get to the end of university, you now have a formal computer science degree. You've still got
These businesses are ticking over on the side, and you're now in. Involved in two businesses, which are very much education, culture, and learning.
Kaido is probably like people, education, you could say on one level. Was there ever a kind of this is the trajectory that I wanna move in from an industry perspective? I know tech is a generic sort of umbrella, you could say, but
The education piece or. People development space or one, someone might be like FinTech or whatever.
Is there any specific industry that you're like, I'm really interested in this and would love to

**Taiyab:** So I would say right now I would say I'm at where I'm at because I essentially followed my nose, right? So what I think, what tends to happen. People follow their nose a little bit first, so they go down a path that seems interesting to them.
And then they go down it, they go down it, they go down it.
And then after a certain level of time is lapsed on either that thing or they've explored a bunch of things, then they start. Maybe making specific judgments about which industries or what problems they want to tackle specifically. So I'd say I'd gotten involved with Kaido and Exercism in large part by being connected with Jeremy and getting to know him.
And I didn't even tell you the story about how I got to know him and where I met him as well, which

**Jonathan:** that. We could do that in a second, but

**Taiyab:** right. Yeah. Sure. But yeah, so sorry, I lost my train.

**Jonathan:** I know it's just about like specific industry specific

**Taiyab:** Ah, yeah, so it was more like, I just loved designing products and I just wanted to work on stuff that was interesting. So when I was asked various things, especially when Jeremy and I chatted and we talked through stuff, it seemed like a really interesting problem to try and tackle.
So it's always, for me, it was just, what's the problem that I, that looks interesting for me to tackle? Let's go and tackle it. I am starting. Get a flavor for the problems that I care about in the world and where I wanna address. But that's I think more of a thing for the next, that's gonna develop more in the next, I think three or four years or the coming years for sure.

**Jonathan:** Cool. And yeah. So now you met Jeremy Post University somewhere along the line. What was that all about?

**Taiyab:** There's another story embedded in here. So I actually met Jeremy whilst I was at university.
We didn't go to the same university. He's 10 years older than me. But what ended up happening is I went to, So I told you I was into startups and business and entrepreneurship and all that.
So there was a startup hack. That was being conducted at a local university at Aston University. Shouts to Aston.
And, So my friend and I decided to attend this hack weekend cuz why not? We're interested in tech, we're interested in designing and developing stuff. Why not? So yeah, I went to this event and then There were various pitches to get put into groups and whatnot, and I remember Jeremy pitching for his idea.
And the idea was a home automation thing, basically.

**Jonathan:** Of his time. Smart
cities and smart homes, all of that kind of jazz. Yeah.

**Taiyab:** exactly. It was smart . It was a home automation tool called ia, which is like a Hindi word for I think like a caretaker or something. And yeah, it was the whole home automation thing. You wake up in the morning the blinds come up, the lights come on,
the coffee's brewing, , all of that.
So this was the idea that Jeremy Peterson and I got involved. Basically I got, I wanted to join his group. His idea sounded interesting and that's where I met Jeremy and a couple other colleagues of mine too. And yeah, and that was 11 years ago, I think. Something like that. And then later on what happened is I got involved in Jeremy's startup after that.
So he was running a company in the medical education space and he was hiring designers and he was really keen to have me on. So from that initial startup hack weekend, then to meeting up afterwards in coffee shops and things yeah, we got to know each other. And then I joined his journey for his startup whilst I was at university.
So what I did is I had this problem right. Do I spend the next two years at university or do I join this startup and try and make it work like that in

**Jonathan:** a In a like shorter space of time

**Taiyab:** You're right.
So this was the dilemma I was having, I'm sure a lot of people have this same dilemma a lot of the time.
So I thought, Okay, I've got this problem here and this problem here. How can I get both right? How can I do both? Cause I didn't wanna just stick to one. I thought, Okay, what I can do is I can go to the university and. Can I do a year in industry? And then go to Jeremy and be like, I'm doing a year in.

**Jonathan:** You need to hire me.

**Taiyab:** You just hire me

**Jonathan:** you,

**Taiyab:** So that's how I pitched it. So I went to the university and said I wanna do a year in industry, even though I had no intentions to year in industry prior to that. And then I went to Jeremy and I'm doing a year in industry. I can work for you for a year like that.
And that's how it all started. So then I joined education, which was his previous startup. And then and then, yeah, and then we worked through that. And then I did end up leaving and going to university and finishing my degree, but then fast forwarding to now so we're talking almost 10 years later that we reconnect and then we get back into things and then I join Exercism and we all go from there.

**Jonathan:** Okay, cool. So thank you for going through the history of time, like in, in a very short space of time. We've covered a heck of a lot of ground, which is really cool. So now what would you do? Recommend to anyone who's signing up to Exercism or is wanting to start off that coding journey?
Like what would be hinted at a few times like find the problem to solve potentially and all of that kind of stuff, but what would be your kind of key recommendations to someone who's wanting to step into the tech space and get their feet under the table? You could say.

**Taiyab:** So I would recommend a few things. First is just to get a lay of the land, right? Understand what you're getting into. Have a strong reason as to why you're getting into it. And also understand that it's gonna be a difficult journey. And just understand that and expect that with anything that's worth it.
It's hard to. Things that are hard to do are rewarding and programming is not different, right? There's definitely a fun element to it as well. It's amazing to just go in and be able to build stuff and write stuff, but, you need to learn the foundational stuff to do that for initially and there's effort required there.
So just understand that. I would say that secondly go for the very novice focused platforms and tools that currently exist. So have a look around. There's plenty of them out there. Give them a try first. See if it's for you.
So just get your feet wet a little bit really, And then once if you love it and you start getting, and love is a very strong word here, but if you're interested in it and you're getting.
You're saying, Okay, this is interesting. I wanna do a bit more than just keep following your nose on it. Keep at it more and more every day. I would say that finishing one of these novice platforms is a good idea too. Like getting to a hundred percent completion on them Is a good step.
And then if you've got an appetite for more, just keep going. Go and sign up for Exercism. Go and sign up to all these other things that exist Code Academy or a or a tree house or something like that. And really get your teeth stuck in. But you have to keep dipping your feet in more and see if you.

**Jonathan:** Not sure. I think one of the, my observations for me personally was you can get this like a real ex moment of excitement. Oh, I want to learn how to code. And then you like to set sail and then you hit a brick wall where it's wow, there's so many people to choose from. Where do I start? And then you actually have to explore the different ways that people teach as well before you can really be like, Actually this is how I relate to this issue really. And then once you've done that, then it's okay for the next phase. You actually have to, I would say break the problem down. Like you mentioned previously, into very small kinds of achievable steps. Cause if you're like, Oh, I wanna write a website in JavaScript or React, or whatever it's gonna be.
So it's gonna be, feel really far out there. No, I think that's really good advice. Couple more questions for you Todd, today. So we have this concept called the hill that you would die on, in these shows that we've been doing. And it sounds pretty melodramatic and maybe it is. But the concept is essentially, is there one opinion or thought that you would hold fast to. Within the tech industry that you think is non-negotiable, something that you would absolutely fight tooth and nail, maybe a bit strong, but if you know what I mean, Like you would really say this, I believe this is key.
I'm not gonna budge on this. What would that opinion be and how would you explain that to everyone
Listening?

**Taiyab:** so this wouldn't be maybe a specific technology opinion or thought it's more a bit broader than that. But I think as, just as a society or just as the world, we're experiencing a very unprecedented time where the people that control the computers and the robots have all the.
Basically and what's not happening is there's not enough of a trickle down of value to the people who are not developing those technologies or own them to have the strengths or the augmentations that they give you, right? Because by this, at this point, we're all androids, right?
Pretty much, we have these devices in our pockets. They power our thoughts and they give us access to all this technology. They let us do crazy things that we weren't previously able to do. But the thing is, like a lot of that power is still being owned and controlled and harvested by big companies, et cetera, et cetera.
I would say we still haven't learned as a society to give that value to everyone.
And I think that's something that I've been thinking about more and more. It's something that I am passionate about, quite passionate about, and I've been doing a lot of reading around just trying to figure out, and this problem being, trying to be tackled on multiple levels.
Of course, Giving people just more accessibility to programs is a way of putting that power into the hands of everyday people. But also politicians are trying to do it from their level. And, there other organizations on various levels are trying to do that too. So that's something that I care quite deeply about, and it's something that I'm watching with a vivid eye.
, I can't tell you that I have a specific, like part of that I'm gonna either execute on or work on or whatever. But Exercism is a platform that kind of works towards a lot of that.
From what we can do and what's within my power to do I think I'm at least making a small dent into that problem.
For.

**Jonathan:** So what, so then really practically speaking and maybe this is putting on the spot here, like what could you and I do like today that would just make things a little bit more accessible? I know you spoke about Exercism trying to be as accessible as possible, but how would you position your mind and the actions that you enact today to, to that out a little bit?

**Taiyab:** Yeah, it would be, Yeah. It's a very difficult question, I would say. We, I could tell you the typical thing of introducing programming literacy to everyone, et cetera, et cetera. But even that doesn't do it justice. Like what we are seeing, for example, is a lot of innovation in ai, a lot of innovation in obviously crypto stuff too and all that.
And we're starting to see a bit of that value coming down to us. So for example if you look at a lot of these ai kind of image generators. You can now just write a couple keywords into an AR tool and it'll generate like a beautiful painting for you, basically. It's actually a tool made by Discord, I think.
But yeah, what I would say specifically is that we could, we should probably just do a better job of, I guess our immediate vicinity or immediate families. So we talk about this on a very EX is a platform that's doing this and this, but maybe we. Teach our own families to do the things that we talk about, right?
Maybe our parents especially, they might have been out of the fold quite a bit in terms of technology. Maybe they don't use their smartphone as much as they could. Maybe they don't know how to do any of the basic things that we take for granted every day. So I think definitely teaching older generations how to adopt technology and.
Teaching younger generations too. And just ensure that our community, in our immediate vicinity, in our immediate area have, know about the tools, have access to them, and then are trained to use them in a confident way as well.
Yeah, I think that's what would make a huge impact.

**Jonathan:** And I think just to comment on that as well, maybe one thing is your entrepreneurial is also to be like, how can we bridge the gap between what is perceived as very complex and make it simpler? Not that's always that easy to do, but but maybe build that level of abstraction that just allows more people
to

**Taiyab:** I also feel it's just a it's more of just like a cultural or just a general societal problem Anyway, so I see us also aging out of younger technology, right? So we're not that young. I dunno how old you are, Jonathan, but I'm in my early thirties,

**Jonathan:** 35.

**Taiyab:** 35, so we're in our thirties, right?
And there are things that I've heard about or don't even have a clue about that the twenties and the teens are doing. I don't have, I have no. . So I think there is a natural, also a natural not calcification, but almost like you just don't know what's on the younger side of things where you don't know what the young kids are doing or you don't

**Jonathan:** Your brain doesn't move as fast.

**Taiyab:** brain doesn't.
Yeah, the brain doesn't move as fast. Yeah.
Not as neuroplastic. And we're not, and also we're busy. We're busy doing stuff. We're busy building something. We're doing our day to day jobs, and therefore we're not able to have that exploratory phase anymore, of going and discovering new technologies and discovering new things.
Whereas younger people, obviously, they're not working a job typically, so they can go off and explore AI and explore this and explore that and learn so many cool new things that we get aged out of a little bit.
So I think there's just an issue of time too, and giving yourself the space and freedom to explore.

**Jonathan:** Oh, cool. No that's spot on. So one more question then before we come into land. It's been an hour of goodness so far. What recommendation would you give to the Exercism community? And it can be anything, it can be as lighthearted as you want, which is, and buy an ice cream or whatever. or it can be as like, get into hectic fitness regime. That's what you need to do. What recommendation would you make to our community this week? That they just absolutely had to try?

**Taiyab:** So two things, and these are two things that I'm working on and I'm not very good at. So I'm not preaching here. I'm just saying these are things that we should all focus on as a collective community. One is getting better at communication.
Not necessarily written communication, but spoken communication.
One problem that I find in a lot of development developer communities is that we're good at problem solving from a very logical standpoint. We're not good at articulating that problem or articulating that solution very well.
Being able to build a narrative, being able to tell a story. Definitely are skills that a typical programmer should learn.
Just how to communicate better. So that's one thing. And the second thing would be to just maybe develop a bit more a bit more grit, I would say. So just understanding that things are not gonna always go your way. And things, life will just throw stuff at you and you're gonna have to deal with it.
So I think those two things are definitely valuable skills that we should all develop more. For sure. I

**Jonathan:** And that's awesome. I think just off the back of your grit comment, which I really like, Facing things head on is way more beneficial than running away from the problem. And I think
That's just something that I found true in the last couple of years for me is there's an issue.
It's better to walk towards it and go through it than it is to try and skirt
around it and

**Taiyab:** Yeah.

**Jonathan:** not

**Taiyab:** And sometimes you, you'll need to amp yourself up a little bit maybe. That's where all the physical fitness comes into it. The reason why people, one of the reasons why people go to the gym is it gives them confidence. It gives them the kind of feeling of wanting to tackle the dates.
I would say yeah, amp yourself up and go and tackle those things. Look, go and tackle those demons that you know are there.

**Jonathan:** Yeah. Yeah. Run at them. To thank you so
much for your time today. It's always great hearing people's stories and getting those little nuggets, and there's plenty of goodness in what we've just spoken about today. So I really appreciate the time. Thank you for all of the work you put into the amazing designs of Kaido and Exercism and for the ongoing work that you've done.
And if you wanna reach out to Taiyab, a chat about design. I'm sure he's all right. We don't want the world sort of bang down your door, but if that happens, and we won't complain, this

**Taiyab:** Feel free to message me on Slack. I'm there next to them Slack, and you can tweet me at tie up T A I Y A B and just hit me up on there so no issue.

**Jonathan:** Great. So go check it out. Go check out the designs that he's put up there, and hopefully this has given you a little bit of an insight into the thought process, the way that Ty Conceptualizes stuff. But again, thank you and we'll touch base in a second. But thanks again, Taiyab. Thank you for your time.
And check you soon.

**Taiyab:** Thank you, Jonathan.

**Jonathan:** Cool.
