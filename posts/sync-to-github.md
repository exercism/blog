# Sync to GitHub

Hi everyone!

We've spent the last few months working hard on our [Coding Fundamentals](https://exercism.org/courses/coding-fundamentals) and [Front-End Fundamentals Bootcamp](https://exercism.org/courses/front-end-fundamentals), which have been amazing experiences for us. Now they're finished, we're spending a bit of time working on adding some new features to Exercism's main site!

Today we're launching **two new features** on Exercism:
1. Sync your solutions to GitHub.
2. Save and explore your Favorites.

## Sync your Solutions to GitHub

Having your own public backup of solutions is something that people have been requesting for a long time. 
Many people manually sync their solutions to GitHub or have even written their own scripts to do it, but now that function is **built into Exercism!**

Once you enable the feature, your solutions will start automatically being backed up to GitHub. You can configure whether the backup works via Pull Requests or commits, and do a bulk historic upload of all your solutions!

We quietly launched to Insiders a month back and have now backed up tens of thousands of solutions to GitHub. The more people have used it, the more they've appreciated it. As one Insider said:

> I didn't have strong feelings about this feature when it was first proposed, but now that it is here, I am super happy you have moved forward! I already can't imagine Exercism without it.

To get started, simply go to [your settings](https://exercism.org/settings/github_syncer) and connect a repo. 

## Favorites

Today we're also launching Favorites - a place to store and browse the best solutions you find on Exercism.

Designed as a way for you to capture everything you find interesting, inspiring or impressive, favorites allow you to star solutions as you go around the site and then come back and revisit them whenever you're looking to dig deeper.

To add a favorite, simply click the "Favorite" button on any community solution. You'll see the text change to "Favorited" and the star go gold!
If you want to remove a favorite, just click it again.

Any solutions you've already starred have automatically been migrated into your favorites. You can access Favorites via the Learn menu, or directly via [this link](https://exercism.org/favorites).

## More to come!

We're working on some other exciting features too, including more advanced automatic feedback, explanations of solutions, and a multi-lingual translation of the site - all of which we're planning on launching in the next couple of months. Keep an eye out for details!
